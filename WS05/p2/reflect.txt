1. Why do we try to use variables and macros to represent information rather than hardcode “magic” numbers 
(constant literals)? Using the details of this workshop, describe at least three advantages this provides us?
    First: This allows you to change the values of variables.
    Second: Macros automate repetitive processes.
    Third: It reduces the amount of code we need to write.

2. The rating values entered by the user required iteration to perform basic validations with each iteration 
concentrated on testing for values to be within a specific range. Why do we not include additional logic that 
sums and performs the average? Instead, the sum and average logic is placed outside of any validation routine. 
Briefly explain two reasons why this is better design and refer to the details of this workshop to justify 
your answer.
    Basically, this helps with code maintenance, since using a variable to store this information is more 
    efficient, in addition to facilitating its use in other parts of the software if necessary.
