1. Do you have any previous programming experience? If so, what language(s)? If not, what are your initial thoughts about the C language and this course?
I have already gained proficiency in Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, C++, and have some experience with Python. Currently, I am focused on learning about ReactJS, React Native, and NodeJS to enhance my skills further.

2. Describe your understanding of the compiling process of turning a C text file into an executable program.
To turn a C text file into an executable program, the compiling process has four stages: preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking. During preprocessing, directives are handled. The code is then translated into assembly language during compilation. Assembly code is subsequently converted into object code during assembly. Finally, linking merges object code with external libraries to produce an executable.

3. What do you hope to achieve in this course? Describe your goals and expectations.
My goal for this course is to enhance my proficiency in C++. I aspire to work in game development, and since many companies utilize this language, I believe it's crucial to master it. Additionally, I aim to develop my logical skills in programming and gain a comprehensive understanding of the process.
