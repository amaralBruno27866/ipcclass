1.  With the completion of this workshop, you must have begun to appreciate why code formatting is important.
    Explain how you made your code – especially the iteration and selection logic parts – easy to read and maintain.
        I simply separated them by sectors and identified them with comments.

2.  Nested logic is an important feature of programming in any language. 
    Identify and briefly discuss the biggest impact on how this workshop could be coded if nesting were not possible.
        The logic can vary from programmer to programmer, however, if nesting were not possible it would be much more
        difficult to understand or maintain this code.

3.  Consider the following scenario: you are programming logic that requires a user to input a value between 1 and 5,
    and for each value within that range, you had to perform something unique.
    You would have to apply selection to validate the entered values so you can implement the given logic for a specific
    entered range value. Explain why is it inefficient to achieve this using a series of “if” optional path constructs
    instead of the preferred “if/else if…” alternative path logic?
        You would have to do a lot of validations, which would be unnecessarily repetitive, using an if else if, or a for,
        or a whilw or a do while next to an array, it would be a more efficient way and you could reuse code sectors just by
        changing their values assigned by the user.
