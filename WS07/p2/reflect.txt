1. Were you successful in coding non-repetitive sections of logic in the game play portion of this workshop (drawing of the 
ruler, board, player position, etc.)? If so, how did you accomplish this (don’t provide your code in your answer)?
If not, why? Explain precisely what you struggled with and refer to the logic of the workshop to justify your answer.

2. Explain how the use of structures simplified your program. Provide proof of your argument by contrasting the alternatives – 
do not include code in your answer – you must explain in simple terms the impact the concept of structures has in our 
programming strategies.

3. Examine your code and determine the maximum number of levels of nesting (deepest) you ended up using in your program logic. 
Provide a simple indented outline that illustrates your answer (copy only the construct line for each level and do not include 
all the code within unless there is another nested construct). For example, two levels of nesting as an outline:

if(horse != hen) 
{ 
    while(chickenPecks) 
    { 
        if(food == grain) 
        { 
        } 
    } 
}
